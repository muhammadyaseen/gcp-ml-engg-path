    "This Challenge Lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the [**Building and deploying machine learning solutions with Vertex AI**](). You will be given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the quest to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on the Qwiklabs lab instructions page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.\n",

    "You were recently hired as a Machine Learning Engineer at a startup movie review website. Your manager has tasked you with building a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of user movie reviews as positive or negative. These predictions will be used as an input in downstream movie rating systems and to surface top supportive and critical reviews on the movie website application. The challenge: your business requirements are that you have just 6 weeks to productionize a model that achieves great than 75% accuracy to improve upon an existing bootstrapped solution. Furthermore, after doing some exploratory analysis in your startup's data warehouse, you found that you only have a small dataset of 50k text reviews to build a higher performing solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build and deploy a high performance machine learning model with limited data quickly, you will walk through training and deploying a custom TensorFlow BERT sentiment classifier for online predictions on Google Cloud's [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) platform. Vertex AI is Google Cloud's next generation machine learning development platform where you can leverage the latest ML pre-built components and AutoML to significantly enhance your development productivity, scale your workflow and decision making with your data, and accelerate time to value.\n",

    "![Vertex AI: Challenge Lab](./images/vertex-challenge-lab.png \"Vertex Challenge Lab\")\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will progress through a typical experimentation workflow where you will build your model from pre-trained BERT components from TF-Hub and `tf.keras` classification layers to train and evaluate your model in a Vertex Notebook. You will then package your model code into a Docker container to train on Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Lastly, you will define and run a Kubeflow Pipeline on Vertex Pipelines that trains and deploys your model to a Vertex Endpoint that you will query for online predictions."

      "Review 0: b'\"Pandemonium\" is a horror movie spoof that comes off more stupid than funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy spoofs. \"Airplane\", \"The Naked Gun\" trilogy, \"Blazing Saddles\", \"High Anxiety\", and \"Spaceballs\" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. \"Pandemonium\" is not up there with those films. Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it. Geez, \"Scream\" had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film. How bizarre is that?<br /><br />*1/2 (out of four)'\n",

      "Review 1: b\"David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\n",

I think a lot of Doctors would agree with me that,in the physical shape they were in, some of these firefighters would NOT of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear.

       "'\\nI’m not going to dive into the synopsis of the film because it is widely available online, and frankly, the film “shows” you the story so well that the brief synopsis wouldn’t do the story any justice. I want to applaud every single actor who played roles in this movie. Though I’m sure some acting professors may find criticisms in each of their ability, I believe that they all poured their hearts out playing these characters, the characters who are all fully justified of their own positions. With the origin of the film being a stage play, the film does everything in its power to keep the story intact without feeling the need to show everything, which is difficult to come by in our modern society where everything is shown, rather than told.\\n\\nThe characters are symbolic to say the least. Even though Charlie (Brendan Fraser) and his obesity may seem like a fiction or a non-fiction, it ultimately does not matter. After all, obesity is simply one of the health outcomes that we witness in our lives. One could easily replace Charlie’s obesity with something else and they would end up with the same results as far as the story goes. And Charlie’s not the only character who carries this symbol. Not only is every character in this story symbolic, each one is absolutely justified AND self-righteous. It’s an endless loop that the characters have entrapped themselves in and there is no room for escape. With the unconventional display ratio of the film (not the usual 16:9 ratio), it feels like watching a personal diary that’s filled with self-deprecation, frustration, and sheer agony that is inside a tight box. It is a tough pill to swallow as an audience, but a necessary one as it tells the tale that everyone needs to listen and comprehend. The film is not preachy to motivate the audience members to be proactive, but rather simply feeds us different combinations of characters’s stories and make us think. That is why I think it is completely pointless to finger at any flaws or imperfections as it only illustrates the humanity behind our perfect selfies and posts. \\n\\nAfter two hours of the film (and ugly-crying for an hour and 30 minutes of it), I started to think how I would describe this film through an analogy. Aesop’s fable of the North Wind and the Sun encapsulates the totality of experience from watching The Whale: at the end of the day, it wasn’t the powerful North Wind who led the individual to take off their cloak, but rather it was the calmly, yet intensely present Sun’s ray. Instead of the fast dynamic of a storm, this film consistently kept on twisting our guts. It continued to linger with both of us long after the film was over, and dare I say that it will remain with us for a long time. Films like this are neither easy to watch, nor easy to come by. The ugliness of humanity shows up in many forms and shapes that we cannot ignore or escape from them. Maybe if we let go of our self-righteousness, and maybe if we stopped giving into the hubris that the characters in this film commit to, maybe, just maybe the potential of humanity might expand and shake the world a bit more. Salute to all the actors, the director, the writer, the creative professionals for bringing this film into our world!\\n'"

    "Congratulations! You walked through a full experimentation, containerization, and MLOps workflow on Vertex AI. First, you built, trained, and evaluated a BERT sentiment classifier model in a Vertex Notebook. You then packaged your model code into a Docker container to train on Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Lastly, you defined and ran a Kubeflow Pipeline on Vertex Pipelines that trained and deployed your model container to a Vertex Endpoint that you queried for online predictions."
